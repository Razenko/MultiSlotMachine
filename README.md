# MultiSlotMachine
MultiSlotMachine is a project made by students of [Stenden University](https://stenden.com/) as part of the computer science course. 
The project is written in [Java](https://www.java.com).

### Usage
Since the project is created in [Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) the easiest way to run the application is to import it directly in IntelliJ. Obviously other Java IDE's can be used as well. **Make sure the latest Java SDK is installed!** 

[You can also download precompiled releases.](https://github.com/Razenko/MultiSlotMachine/releases)

When running the application the user can create multiple slot machines and insert (virtual) currency. The total amount of inserted currency of all slot machines is then added to the jackpot. When one of the machines hits three *'Big Wins'* the jackpot will be awarded to the respective slotmachine and the jackpot will reset.
